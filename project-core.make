; Make it possible to set SameSite attribute for Drupal session cookie.
; IMPORTANT: this patch is only compatible with PHP versions < 7.3. If using PHP
; versions >= 7.3 SameSite attribute will not be set. At the time of writing
; there's no working patch for these versions. There's an ongoing discussion
; about how to handle this.
; See: https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3170525#comment-13834908.
