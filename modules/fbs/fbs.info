# Features will mark any module that implements hook_field_info() as required.
# This causes the module to be enabled automatically during site-install, which
# in the case of a Ding-provider is a problem.
# To prevent "required = 1" line below has been commented out. When a future
# feature-export reintroduce the line make sure to ignore it and keep this
# block of comments and the out-commented line intact.
# required = 1
