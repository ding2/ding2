/**
 * @file
 * This module tries to create better caching between varnish and drupal by
 * allowing varnish to cache content type pages based on user roles when users
 * are logged in.
 *
 * This is achieved by using a menu callback and a new header variable
 * 'X-Drupal-Roles' that varnish can react on. The module uses the 'vary' header
 * in combination with X headers to allow varnish to cache content based on user
 * roles.
 *
 * The basic idea used in this module is taken form the link below.
