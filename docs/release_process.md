# Release proces

This document describes how to create a new release.

## Naming

The naming scheme is based on a combination of [Drupal release name conventions](https://www.drupal.org/node/1015226) and [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Each release is named in the format `[Drupal major version].x-[Project major version].[Project minor version].[Project patch version]-[Pre-release information (optional)]`.

An example name could be `7.x-3.4.2-rc1`.
