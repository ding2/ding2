# Code guidelines

The following guidelines describe best practices for developing code for the Ding project. The guidelines should help achieve:

* A stable, secure and high quality foundation for building and maintaining library sites
* Consistency across multiple developers participating in the project
* The best possible conditions for sharing modules between Ding sites
* The best possible conditions for the individual Ding site to customize configuration and appearance

Contributions to the core Ding project will be reviewed by members of the Core team. These guidelines should inform contributors about what to expect in such a review. If a review comment cannot be traced back to one of these guidelines it indicates that the guidelines should be updated to ensure transparency.

We acknowledge that not all current code in core complies with these guidelines. We hope that updates to core along the way will move the code base in the right direction.


## Coding standards

The project adheres to the following coding standards.

The project aims to automate compliance checks as much as possible. This should make it easier for developers to check contributions before submitting them for review and thus make the review process easier.

If there are discrepancies between the automated checks and the standards defined here then developers are encouraged to point this out so the automated checks or these standards can be updated accordingly.

### General

* The default language for all code and comments is English.

### PHP

* Code must be compatible with PHP 5.3. [Compatibility can be checked using PHP_Codesniffer](https://github.com/wimg/PHP53Compat_CodeSniffer).
* Code must conform to the [Drupal Coding Standards](http://drupal.org/coding-standards). In effect this means that the code must pass through an automated review by the [Coder Sniffer](https://www.drupal.org/node/1419980) without any notices expect known false negatives.
* Code must not generate notices without erroneous conditions when running in `E_STRICT` error mode 

### JavaScript

It is recommended that JavaScript code is checked by [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) using the configuration provided by the `.jshintrc` file located in the root of the repository.

### CSS

* Code must pass through an automated review by [CSSLint](http://csslint.net/) without any notices The following rules are used: `display-property-grouping, duplicate-properties, empty-rules, known-properties, box-sizing, compatible-vendor-prefixes, gradients, vendor-prefix, import, zero-units, shorthand, important, regex-selectors, universal-selector, duplicate-background-images`.
* Modules and themes may use SASS + Compass (we use [libSass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) and [compass-mixins](https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins)). It is the responsibility of the developers to compile these to CSS files. If the developers uses external libraries (e.i. compass) the version used have to be documented in the scss file.
* If code is compiled/preprocessed it must be described in the header of the compiled file. If any external libraries are used these have to be documented as well in the header.
* It is highly recommended that all style-sheets are documented after [KSS](http://warpspire.com/posts/kss/)


## Documentation

* `README.txt`: All modules must contain a `README.md` file containing the following where applicable:
	* A brief description of the module - preferably with a screenshot
	* Configuration options
	* Installation procedure
	* Hidden variables
	* Other requirements and how to obtain these such as API urls, versions, keys, library system and trimmings
	* Any code which does not comply with these guidelines and a brief argument why


## Naming

### General

* All names must be in English.

### Modules

* All modules written specifically for Ding must be prefixed with either `ding` or `ting` e.g. `ding_your_module`. Which prefix to choose depends on the scope of the module:
	* Modules dealing primarily with the Open* webservices should be prefixed with `ting` e.g. `ting_search_autocomplete`.
	* Modules providing functionality based on library systems or the Ding content model should be prefixed with `ding` e.g. `ding_event`.
* The prefixed are not required for modules which provides functionality deemed relevant outside the Ding sphere e.g. Blackhole and Opening Hours.

### Files

Files provided by modules must be placed in the following folders and have the extensions defined here.

* General
	* `MODULENAME.info`
	* `MODULENAME.module`
	* `MODULENAME.install`
	* `includes/*.inc`
	* `templates/*.tpl.php`
	* `*.theme.inc`
* CSS
	* CSS files must use the BAT (Base/Admin/Theme) naming schema as described [here](http://drupal.org/node/1089868).
	* `/css/*.(base|admin|theme).css`
	* `/sass/*.(base|admin|theme).scss`
	* `/sass/libs/*`
* JavaScript
	* Files must have to include the module name to easily find their origin during debugging
	* `/js/*.MODULENAME.js`
* Images
	* Images resources must be placed in a folder named `img` and have the following extensions.
	* `img/*.(png|jpeg|gif)`
* External resources (PHP and JavaScript libraries) must be included using [Libraries API version 2.x module](http://drupal.org/project/libraries)


## Module elements

Programmatic elements such as variables, content types, views and panel pages, defined in modules must comply to a set of common guidelines.

* Machine names should be prefixed with the name of the module that defines them
* Administrative titles, human readable names and descriptions should contain the purpose of the view
* If a programmatic element supports tagging e.g. rules and views one of the tags must be the name of the module that defines them 

As there is no finite set of programmatic elements for a Ding site these apply to all types except if explicitly specified below.

### Guidelines for specific elements

* Panel variants (handlers) must not use auto generated names as this increases the risk of different modules implementing variants for the same pages overwriting each other. Instead use `module_name_page_name_variant_name` e.g. `ding_blog_node_view_blog` *NB: Auto generated names is the default behavior when using features!*


## Code Structure

Modules, themes etc. should be placed within the corresponding folder in this repository. If a module developed in relation to this project is of general purpose to the Drupal community it should be placed on Drupal.org and included as an external dependency.

If a module has external dependencies these should be declared within the `project.make` file located in the root of this repository so that they are downloaded automatically during a build. Dependencies can be projects on Drupal.org or external resources. It is recommended that dependencies specify a specific version.

A module should provide all required code and resources for it to work on its own or through dependencies. This includes all configuration, theming, CSS, images and JavaScript libraries.

All default configuration required for a module to function should be implemented in code. The preferred way of doing this is using the [Features module](https://www.drupal.org/project/features) or hooks provided by the module itself. Modules where configuration cannot be handled using Features should maintain configuration using `hook_install()` and `hook_update_N()`.

If a module requires configuration for which there is no sensible default the module must implement `hook_ding_install_tasks()` such that users can perform the necessary configuration during installation.

All default text content in modules must be in English. Localization of content must be handled using the Drupal translation modules. 


## Updating core modules

If a core module is expanded with updates to current functionality the default behavior must be the same as previous versions or as close to this as possible. This also includes new modules which replaces current modules.

If an update does not provide a way to reuse existing content and/or configuration the update then the decision on whether to include the change resides with the Ding team. If the Ding team can not reach an agreement the Ding Council will make the decision.


## Altering existing modules

Modules which alter or extend functionality provided by the core modules should use appropriate alter hooks to override these instead of forking these modules.

In cases where modules provide layered configuration modules should implement new layers with a higher priority than default configuration instead of altering the default configuration. This is often handled through lower weights. To support multiple modules providing separate layers of configuration without conflicts identifiers must be unique to the module as opposed to auto-generated. This may require altering auto-generated code manually. The recommended way to generate unique identifiers would be to prefix the existing identifier with the module name. Example: Panel variants.

It is preferable to add a new layer to layered configuration instead of altering an existing layer provided by the core modules. This ensures that alterations and extensions work as expected even when the core modules are updated. This means that sites which use alterations may not reflect the latest changes to core. It is deemed preferable instead of potentially breaking the site.
