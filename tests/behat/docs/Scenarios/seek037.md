# Scenario: Seek037

Show accessInfomedia.

Used known data to look up objects with accessInfoMedia relations on them.

## Method
See also seek040.

The filename is set to the right data file, and a random entry is taken out, then displayed.
Then it is examined if the 'hasReview' class can be found. ('hasReview' is translated to the actual class).

**Notice**
__This test is currently marked as WIP, because accessInfoMedia is not well defined at this time. 
It has been developed as if it is simply a reference to an external review, but clarification is required.__
