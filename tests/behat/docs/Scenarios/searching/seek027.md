# Scenario: Seek027

Search and display material should show cover page.

By searching for material with high probability to have cover images,
it opens up one of the found results with cover image shown, and
checks that on the object page a cover image is also shown.

## Method
See seek016 for details on the ADDI service.

## Notes
Excluded from CCI, see seek016 for details.

We use ting_covers_placeholder to populate materials with placeholder
covers.
