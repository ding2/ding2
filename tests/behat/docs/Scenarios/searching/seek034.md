# Scenario: Seek034

Show Object Details.

Use known data to look up objects and check that they have details info shown.
## Method
See also seek040.

The filename is set to the right data file, and a random entry is taken out, then displayed.
Then it is examined if the 'hasDetails' entry can be found. ('hasDetails' is 
translated to the actual css locator to be found, which equals the 'Detaljer om materialet'
link).
