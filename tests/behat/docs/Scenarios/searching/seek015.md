# Scenario: Seek015

Check samlinger is shown on search result.

Performs a search and checks that at least one record is a Materialesamling (collection).

## Method
To identify a collection the following method is used:

1. The object must be available in more than one format, ex. Bog, Lydbog, etc.
2. If this is true, then it is reckonned as a collection.
3. The link to the object always contain 'collection', even if it's not, so that cannot be used.
4. If a collection consists of only one format, say Lydbog, it is not identified. We live with this limitation, as there are plenty of collections with diverse formats.
