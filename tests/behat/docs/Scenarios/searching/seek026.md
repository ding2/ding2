# Scenario: Seek026

Tests if 
1. online access button is shown,
2. add to list buttons, 
3. reservation buttons, and 
4. prompting to login by reservation
distributed on 4 scenarios.

## Method
See also seek040.

By using known data from pre-created data files to display a random object from file.
Then it checks based on css-class identifiers if the information is available.

For checking prompting to login, if not already logged in, by clicking Reserv√©r, it is checked if the login fields are being shown. It is also documented by a screenshot. Login is not actually attempted.
  

## Notes
The login prompt scenario is currently excluded from the CCI suite, because the built site on CircleCI seems to use a different opensearch agency and/or service, despite attempts to reconfigure it. 

Also tests for reservations are not on CCI because its 
currently not possible to determine the exact dataset used there.
