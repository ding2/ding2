# Scenario: Seek016

Check forsidebillede is shown on search result.

Performs search and checks that at least one record in the result has
a cover image.

## Method
Notice that cover pages are only present if configured, and
configuration requires credentials. Also, the search string used
currently seems to be best for finding cover pages. This may change
over time.

## Notes

We use ting_covers_placeholder to populate materials with placeholder
covers.
