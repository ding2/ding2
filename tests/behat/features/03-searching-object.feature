Feature: test object displays after search
  In order to check searches and showing of materials on the DDB CMS
  As a user
  I want to do searches and examine the search result for
  - if creatorDescriptions are being shown if present
  - if accessInfomedia relations are being shown if present
  Numbering refers to the lines in the redroute spreadsheet for testing searching (seek004 is line 4)
