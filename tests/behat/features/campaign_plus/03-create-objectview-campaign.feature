Feature: Creation of object view campaigns
  In order to create object view campaigns in DDB CMS
  As an administrator
  I want to create campaigns and verify that they are triggered correctly when users
  view materials on the site
  The "object view" trigger if the object being viewed is in the result set for the
  CQL query entered in "Search query" field for the campaign trigger

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a cms user with the administrators role

  @api @campaign_plus @regression @cci
  Scenario: Create a 'object view' campaign and show it on a page
    Given I go to the create campaign plus page
    And I fill a campaign with the following:
      | Title | Behatman & Robin       |
      | Type  | Text only              |
      | Text  | Bats 4ever             |
      | Link  | <front>                |
      | Style | BÃ¥nd                   |
    And I set the object view trigger with the search query "Batman"
    And I save the campaign
    # View "Batman - Af Tim Burton (2013)"
    And I am on "ting/object/870970-basis%3A50711161"
    Then the campaign "Behatman & Robin" should appear on the page
    # View "Superman IV - Af Sidney J. Furie (2014)"
    And I am on "ting/object/870970-basis%3A51191331"
    Then the campaign "Behatman & Robin" should not appear on the page
